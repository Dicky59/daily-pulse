# AI Summaries Feature Rules

## Overview

The app will include an **AI-driven article summarization feature**.
The goal is simplicity, keeping everything inside the existing **feature-based architecture**.

This feature must:

- Summarize article content using an external AI API (e.g. OpenAI or similar).
- Display the summary in the UI **inside the existing Articles feature**.
- Integrate cleanly with MVVM.
- Avoid any new domain layer, use case layer, or over-engineering.

## Architectural Principles

- All summary-related code stays _within the Articles feature_.

  - Use cases
  - Base classes
  - Interfaces for repositories

Keep it consistent with the rest of the project.
